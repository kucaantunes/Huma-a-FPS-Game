INTRODUCTION
The year is 3000, the human race no longer exist, due to world pollution, the reality now is dominated by machines, droids, and genetic modified beings. The robots with automatic learning were able to create a new type of being the crafters, these beings are based on perfection, faster than humans, stronger than robots and have skills that make them undefeatable.
Nevertheless in the year 2019 an informatics engineer that studied at ISCTE programmed a virus before world destruction, he placed the virus inside a robot, this virus made the robot pick up the last remains of human dna and created Huma the last representation of the human race. 
Aware of the threat Alice a virtual software, created genetic modified beings that are stronger than the crafters, and with human figure in order to find Huma the real last resistance of the human race.
In this game you are Huma, the all society sees you as a threat, you have to survive in a new fantasy world.
Due to the machine learning implemented in the AI of Alice, the need of catching Huma is unstoppable because these machines were developed with the need of growing knowledge and desire huma to increase their know how of the previously existent human race.
Aliens that have an unreachable technology, able to see what is happening on earth, noticed the changes on the behaviors of Alice (Artificial Intelligence implemented to control everything), and send troops and a virus in the air that has the ability to control the genetic modified beings that breed, giving them more strength; in a more advanced level, huma has to fight these new opponents just to survive.
Miraculously, Huma finds the robot who created him, and gives him the knowledge of creating other beings based on human DNA.
THE PROJECT
This Project is based on replicating real events into a computer game that describes the behavior of different types of AIs and how they interact with the environment.
It was used different types of render and different software for imaging treatment, and for the processing and sequencing of different units.
It reveals the simulation of futuristic battle scene.
WHAT IS THE GAME
TPS (Third-Person Shooter) that can be changed to first person view, with also a vehicle third view, the objective of the game is to complete missions. First level is based on fighting the crafters and reach checkpoint. Second level is based on driving a car and reaching the destiny. Third level based on realism and fight characters that look human. The forth level consists on finding the robot in a fictitious city.

Tests
Formal Test â€“ Unit testing.
To not crash, find bugs, not appearing error messages on run time. 
Code tests, 
API and database testing
Capability Testing
Test on Windows
User Level Testing
Check the time it takes for players to start testing and understand the contentsâ€¦
Theme choice
This theme was chosen due to the technical requirements of making a game it uses an engine in this case it was cryengine and use of 3DS Max and Adobe Flash, the application runs on Windows x86.
During the development of this project several sprints were performed where it was defined the objectives of the project.
Nowadays the tendency of playing computer games with high graphic capacity is high, there are several cases of success like flappy birds, angry birds, minecraft, and the games from electronic arts, gameloft and warner bros, among many other cases.
Due to the timeline restriction, the project only has 4 type of levels and 8 types of characters, one of the levels is a city and occupies too much space and processing capacity.
The city level should run ok on higher capacity computers, although one of the objectives of the project is that the application works fine for different types of computers.
When pressing some buttons the processor takes some time to execute for example loading levels, because the levels 
have lots of information that delay the execution, although this delay time will not occur in computers with higher processor capacity.
The game uses new strategies and responses.
First person shooting games have been developing, and it is something that is easy to sell.
Nielsen Heuristics

System`s limitations
This system in order to be executed it is recommended a minimum speed of 2.0 Ghz, it has been tested on Windows 8.1 and windows 10. It does not require the installation of extra libraries.
The city level because it has a city requires a high processor capacity in order to be played.
Does not require a web browser. It has a limit of the number of levels. The display size can be costumized.
It requires the use of computer and a mouse. The levels/scenarios have boundaries. When the robots are shot, they bleed. The robot, genetic modified beings and vehicles AI stay Idle when the player is not there. Requires Visual Studio, 3D Max, Flash, etcâ€¦ on the dev computer.
It is running for some versions of Windows.
SYSTEM`S FUNCTIONALITIES
The system has a menu interface with a video and music. 2 Different musics were selected for this application one during the menu and another during in game. The system should have the functionalities of shooting, changing weapon, run and crouch.
The HUD should display current and maximum levels of health, it should show ammo level, oxygen and also stamina to not allow the player to run continuously.
It should have the functionalities of choosing vehicles and levels.
It has 4 scenarios, desert, city airport and jungle, and 5 optional vehicles.
The opponent robots should have an intelligent system of following points on the scenario that are not visible, it has AI path, motion and the robots have different behaviors.
It should have the functionality of changing view, there are currently 2, one that the camera is behind the player (third person), and a second one that is the first person camera.
The functionality of returning to the main menu.
The functionality of showing a congratulations panel based on trigger when the player car reaches the final check point.
Should be user friendly.
GAME COMPARISON
It has been compared the game Huma with Crysis 3, both use the same engine, Crysis 3 has more levels and cinematics. Huma has more vehicles implemented. CryEngine has been bought by Amazon and has faced several changes. Huma is easier to play because on crisis 3 the enemies have more health.
Both games have a main menu and an in game menu, Huma allows the use of multiplayer.
Huma HUD has been changed during classes.
Crysis 3 can be played on PlayStation and Xbox.
 
 
Figure 15. Comparison of the game Huma with Crysis3.
 
COMPARISON OF HUMA WITH GTA
GTA has full cities and inside buildings implemented, it also has roads, highways and a several amount of cars. Huma has more realistic looking humans.
GTA has several versions and is full of characters that act like citizens. It has several type of missions and the player can pick up cars. Huma has a limited type of vehicles and a limited type of humans and the levels are much smaller. 
 
Figure 16. Comparison of the game Huma with GTA.
 
THEORETICAL ADJUSTMENT
This project will consider future scenarios, and the development of Huma II with other technologies.

The objective is to simulate a futuristic robot battle. This simulation is based on time.

Another analysis will take in consideration the speed, the AI health and the response to the player moves.
It will have a HUD, mentioning the current levels of health, oxygen, stamina and ammo of the player and also the weapon that he is currently using.
It has the option for the AI to follow the player. 
CURRENT PROBLEM
The current problem is to develop a full game, making it functional and accordant with the requirement
The motivation is to be able to simulate a futuristic robot battle with high level of realism, and try to obtain samples of information that can be processed with logical algorithms. In order to obtain an effective system.
The system will try to simulate a battle where you control one of the players, and will have to survive and fight them back...
MARKET SEGMENTATION
The game aims for the foreign market. The majority of the target audience will be men from an age range between 18 and 70. 
The game will have a small price being accessible to people with different income.
â€¢	For the stand alone vesion Windows 64 bits use of steam.
â€¢	For the web by the of paypal and google payments.
â€¢	For the mobile use of google play.
TECHNOLOGIES
The project was developed mainly in C# and also uses Lua, C++, XML, and. It uses the SDK of Visual Studio. It has several functionalities implemented.
Use of APIs for communication between different applications 
It was used also Visual Studio Flash, 3Ds Max and Notepad++.
It was used several libraries from CryEngine and assets in order to give certain functionalities, in example to change level among others
.  Figure 16. CRYENGINE logo
EXPECTED RESULTS
The expected results are to simulate a futuristic robot war close to the reality. For different time frames the AI will have the information of where the player is and the best process to fulfill an efficient attack. The levels have several AI areas. Variables like speed, health and ammo will be taken in account.
The system will measure the number of AI elements and will also mention how AI should proceed, there will be correlations between variables and statistics values for different distributions that will be generated for the different scenarios.
It will measure the player performance for each level and will look for the optimization of time. It will present several displays and graphs for the different agentsâ€¦
JUSTIFY THE DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGY 
This project is based on developing futuristic robot battle simulator, the technology used was CryEngine due to time restrictions. Other projects were made in parallel using other engines like Unreal Engine and Unity, it has the limitation that can not be exported to mobile or web.
Many of the new games available are based in unreal engine, but this project was made in order to look the most realistic as possible, strategy followed by many of the bigger companies in the game development area like Ubisoft and Electronic Arts. 
The technology used was 3DS max for modelling and rigging, the major part of the game was made in CryEngine, it was also used OpenShot and other movie editors. 
Decided to follow C# mainly combined with C++ and Lua, and the project is not open source based, although developers vary on the opinion of which technology to be used, the project followed a strategy not based in open source technologies.
It was also used Flash and Action Script. This technology used allows to implement several game components like the menus and the HUDâ€¦
Due to high graphic quality and processing effort, the game works fine on computers with processors above 2.0 Ghz and above 6 GB of RAM.
Tested on several computers the game works fine
The tested computer which works fine was:
10nm 64-bit Octa-Core Processor *2.8GHz + 1.7GHz (Maximum Clock Speed, Performance Core + Efficiency Core)
10nm 64-bit Octa-Core Processor *2.7GHz + 1.7GHz (Maximum Clock Speed, Performance Core + Efficiency Core)
6GB RAM
The CryEngine version used was the latest build. It was upgraded during project development and allowed to place the level city which has a serious GPU consumption.

The second starts in tank to help the journey in order to find the robot who created Huma. The third a desert which Huma will have to cross, The forth a city where the robot is hidden inside a cave.
The main keys for movement are: d - right, a - left, w - up and s â€“ down.
The objective is to reach the final level.
It has several parameters like speed, shooting, moving backwards, turning
HOW TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM
The current problem is to develop a full game, making it functional and accordant with the requirement
The motivation is to be able to simulate a futuristic robot battle with high level of realism, and try to obtain samples of information that can be processed with logical algorithms. In order to obtain an effective system.
The system will try to simulate a battle where you control one of the players, and will have to survive and fight them back...
FUTURE WORK
â€¢	Intention of building a multigame web platform, where games by phone and for PC can be downloaded.
â€¢	The web platform has a user management module.
â€¢	A web platform similar to congregate and miniclip but with games with better quality
â€¢	A second variant of the future work is to use Azure or AWS where via web the player can play high quality AAA games without installing anything on the computer.
ANALYSIS
This Project is based on replicating real events into an animation that describes the behavior of elements and how they interact with the environment.
It was used different types of render and different software for imaging treatment, and for the processing and sequencing of different units.
PARAMETERS AND ENTITIES
It has several parameters like speed, shooting, moving backwards, turning, isIdle, LevelID, PlayeID among others, there are at least 10 AI entities, the AI tank only move around the AI area defined on the scenario, the AI for each level has different wave points, in general for each level were used around 40 AI wave points.
The player entity has several scripts for controlling and interacting with the camera and the keyboard interface.
There was set several parameters like maximum speed, maximum health, for quaternions (when turning) and the camera changes position according mouse movement and player position.

Example used for implementing the HUD in the game:
 CONCLUSION
This project was developed for the curricular unit of Interactive applications, game development and multimedia management. It is intended to simulate a futuristic robot game wars has analogy to the game Star Wars of Electronic Arts.
It has several scenarios, make several analysis and achieve different results according to different factors.
Many parameters were used in order to make it seem more realistic. It also offers the option to save / load the game and multiplayer.
The change of parameters is very important because it will report different values.
This system is made in order to provide different simulations, the programming languages used were C#, C++, Lua, among othersâ€¦
The main goal is to provide fun to the users and obtain different results for different assumptions and different parameters.
This project is based in getting realistic graphics and adapting different types of artificial intelligences for different contexts, it required a deep understanding and knowledge of C# and also an extensive knowledge of several tools like 3DS Max and Adobe Flash, Action Script was used, and aslo an API passing objects in the XML format.
It was required the use of several scripts and the development was continuous. On the beginning of the project other game engines were used like Unreal Engine and Unity, some of the cinematics were made via Unity and Adobe After Effects.
Huma is a story about machine learning and how robots would be more like humans, it has several scenarios, and several vehicles.
It was implemented a stamina / running system as well as a HUD and other mechanism to make the game easier to play, in the project we can find different types of artificial intelligences, for example the crafters have higher health and a different weapon system.
This was developed under an university scope, under the theme of MSc in Informatics Engineering.
